To load all objects in this example consult the searching.loader utility
file (note that the *.loader files are Prolog files).

You will need to also load the objects in the roots example.

You will also need to load the following files in the library directory: 
dates.loader, types.loader, events.loader, metapredicates.loader, and 
hierarchies.loader. Alternatively, you can just load the all.loader file.

Some of the code in this folder is adopted from the book "Prolog Programming
for Artificial Intelligence" by Ivan Bratko.

For a description of the search problems, please see a classical AI book 
(such as the one above) or visit the url <http://www.plastelina.net/games>.
