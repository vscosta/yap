To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

You will need to also load the objects in the roots example.

You will also need to load the following files in the library directory: 
dates_loader, types_loader, events_loader, metapredicates_loader, and 
hierarchies_loader. Alternatively, you can just load the library all_loader 
file.

Some of the code in this folder is adopted from the book "Prolog Programming
for Artificial Intelligence" by Ivan Bratko.

For a description of the search problems, please see a classical AI book 
(such as the one above) or visit the url <http://www.plastelina.net/games>.

This example defines two hierarchies of objects, one for representing 
state-spaces and another for representing search methods:

	state_space
		farmer
		water_jug
		heuristic_state_space
			bridge
			eight_puzzle
			miss_cann

	search_strategy
		blind_search(Bound)
			breadth_first(Bound)
			depth_first(Bound)
		heuristic_search(Threshold)
			best_first(Threshold)
			hill_climbing(Threshold)

Taken together, these two hierarchies implement a framework for solving 
state-space search problems in Logtalk.
