To load all objects in this example consult the searching.loader utility
file (note that the *.loader files are Prolog files).

You will need to also load the objects in the roots example.

You will also need to load the following files in the library directory: 
dates.loader, types.loader, events.loader, metapredicates.loader, and 
hierarchies.loader.

Some of the code in this folder is adopted from the book "Prolog Programming
for Artificial Intelligence" by Ivan Bratko.

The object "performance" only provides correct results for the first solution.
