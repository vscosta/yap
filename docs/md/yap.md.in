This manual was originally written by Vítor Santos Costa, Luís Damas,
Rogério Reis, and Rúben Azevedo. Ricardo Rocha and Miguel Areias have
significant contributios, namely in tabling. Paulo Moura and Ulrich
Neumerkel have consistently provided helpful feedback.  The manual was
largely based on the DECsystem-10 Prolog User's Manual by D.L. Bowen,
L. Byrd, F. C. N. Pereira, L. M. Pereira, and D. H. D. Warren. We have
used comments from the Edinburgh Prolog library written by
R. O'Keefe. Documentation from many built-ins is originally from the
SWI-Prolog manual, with the gracious authorization from Jan
Wielemaker. We would also like to gratefully acknowledge the
contributions from Ashwin Srinivasian.
