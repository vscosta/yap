Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.16.0

Copyright (c) 1998-2004 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================

This folder contains objects, categories, and protocols that implement
predicates for dealing with common Prolog types and structures.

To load a group of objects, protocols, and categories in this library 
change your Prolog working directory to this folder and then consult 
the corresponding *.loader utility file. Currently, there are eight 
groups of entities defined:

	dates
	debugging
	dependents
	events
	hierarchies
	metapredicates
	random
	types

There is also a file named all.loader that will load all entities in the 
seven groups listed above.

Specific notes about each group of objects, categories, and protocols 
can be found in the corresponding *.notes files.

Some of the files contained in this directory represent work in progress 
and are not loaded by default by any loader utility file.

Some of the code in this library is based on public domain Prolog code, 
in particular, code adopted from the Edinburgh Prolog library. The definition 
of predicate reverse/2 in object list is from Richard O'Keefe and can be found 
in its book "The Craft of Prolog".

By default, compiling any group of entities described above generates a .xml 
documenting file for each compiled entity (object, category, or protocol).
See the xml sub-directory for instructions on how to browse the .xml files 
for on-line reading or how to convert the files to print-ready format.

All source files are formatted using four-spaces tabs.
