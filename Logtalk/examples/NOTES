=================================================================
Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.21.2

Copyright (c) 1998-2004 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================


This folder contains several examples of Logtalk programs. A brief 
description of each example is included below.

Each example folder contains a NOTES file and a loader helper file which 
may be used to load all the example entities. In addition, most examples 
contain a SCRIPT file with sample queries for your to try.

Most of these examples need objects, protocols, and categories which are 
defined in the Logtalk standard library or in other examples, so you 
should load them first (see the NOTES files inside the library folder and 
the NOTES file inside each example folder).

Some examples may redefine objects already loaded from other examples.
You may want to restart Logtalk after trying each example.

Some of the examples code have been adopted from public available Prolog 
code and from known Prolog text books and are copyrighted by the respective 
authors.

These are programming examples, meaning that you should study the source 
files to fully understand them.

All examples are formatted using four spaces tabs.

By default, compiling an example generates a .xml documenting file for each 
compiled entity (object, category, or protocol). See the xml folder for 
instructions on how to browse the .xml files for on-line reading or how to 
convert the files to a print-ready format such as PDF.


Here is a short description of each included example:

aliases
	example of using the alias/3 predicate directive to provide alternative 
	names to inherited predicates in order to improve readability

birds
	bird identification expert system
	example adopted from the Adventure in Prolog Amzi! book

bricks
	example of representation and handling of relations using events

classvars
	example of implementation of class variables (as found in Smalltalk)

dcgs
	examples of using DCG rules inside objects and categories

diamonds
	examples of problems and solutions for the "diamond problem"
	(multi-inheritance conflicts and ambiguities)

dynpred
	example of using some of the built-in database handling methods

engines
	example of category composition (importation of categories by other 
	categories) using car engines

errors
	example showing the Logtalk compiler warning and error reporting

inheritance
	examples of public, protected and private inheritance with both 
	prototypes and classes/instances

	Intelligence" book

shapes
	geometric shapes implemented as both a prototype hierarchy and a class 
	hierarchy

sicstus
	examples adopted from SICStus Objects documentation

symdiff
	example of using parametric objects to implement symbolic expression 
	differentiation and simplification

viewpoints
	example on how to implement property and value sharing with prototypes
