=================================================================
Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.29.4

Copyright (c) 1998-2007 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================

This folder contains a Prolog file, "libpaths.pl", which, when loaded, 
defines the library paths for the Logtalk standard library and for all 
the supplied examples. You may customize this file by adding the paths 
to your own "libraries" in order to easily load your own source code.

In order to easily compile and load library and example source files using 
the notation <library>(<entity>), you will need to load the "libpaths.pl" 
into your Prolog compiler after loading the Logtalk compiler/runtime.

You might need to edit the "libpaths.pl" file in order to adapt it to reflect 
your Logtalk installation and your Prolog compiler and operating-system 
requirements (for example, some Prolog compilers do not accept or expand 
environment variables occurring on paths).

As defined, the provided "libpaths.pl" file is already compatible with some 
of the most popular Prolog compilers, running on both MacOS X, Linux, Windows, 
Unix, and Unix-like operating-systems.

The Prolog integration scripts found on the "scripts" directory generate 
scripts and shortcuts that automatically load the copy of the "libpaths.pl" 
file from the Logtalk end-user directory created by the "scripts/cplgtdirs.*" 
scripts. See the "INSTALL" and the "scripts/NOTES" files for more details. 
Note that a few Prolog compilers do not support the <library>(<entity>) 
notation. See the "configs/NOTES" file for details.

The somehow contrived code found on the "libpaths.pl" file is needed to ensure 
compatibility with both the ISO Prolog standard and with most Prolog compilers.
The code could be greatly simplified by using a multifile predicate directive 
for the library path dynamic predicate. Unfortunately, not all Prolog compilers
support multifile predicates.

Prolog compilers that are expected to be compatible with the provided 
"libpaths.pl" file as is, across operating systems:

	* B-Prolog
	* CIAO
	* ECLiPSe
	* GNU-Prolog
	* K-Prolog
	* Qu-Prolog
	* SICStus Prolog
	* SWI-Prolog
	* YAP

Prolog compilers that imply editing the provided "libpaths.pl" file due to 
the lack of support for expanding environment variables on paths:

	* Amzi! Prolog
	* IF/Prolog
	* JIProlog
	* XSB

Feedback on other Prolog compilers is most appreciated.
