To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

This folder contains an example of instance defined methods. When using 
classes and instances, methods must be declared in a class but the method 
definitions may be stored in the instances, either overriding or specializing 
the class definitions.

This example defines the following objects:

	root
		root class defining a method named method/0

	instance1
		simple instance of root inheriting method/0

	instance2
		instance of root overriding the inherited method method/0		

	instance3
		instance of root specializing the inherited method method/0
