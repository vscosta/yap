This folder contains several files that enables .xml documentation files 
created when compiling objects, categories, or protocols, to be converted 
to PDF files, to be viewed in a web browser that supports the W3C standards 
XML, XSLT, CSS and HTML 4, or to be converted to LateX for printing.

You will need to either copy your .xml files to this directory or copy
these files to the directory where the .xml files reside.

Regarding conversion to HTML, the links to  the .xsl files on the .xml 
files and the links to the .css files in the generated .html files assume 
that all files reside in the same directory.

The choice of the default .xsl file to use is made in the config files by 
the lgt_default_compiler_option/2 predicate. You can also choose a different 
.xsl file by using the xsl/1 compiler option in the logtalk_compile/2 or 
logtalk_load/2 calls. The default file is lgtxml.xsl (described below).


Brief description of each file in this folder:
 

lgthtml.xsl

	XSLT file to output HTML files from the .xml files. The links in the
	generated HTML files point to related HTML files. It can be used
	to batch convert XML files to HTML files.


lgtxml.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing .xml files directly in in a browser such as Mozilla 
	(version 0.9.2 or later) or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 for Windows 
	(after installing the latest Microsoft XML Parser Release that is needed 
	for XSL standard compliance). The links in the (internally generated) 
	HTML files point to related XML files.


lgtpdfa4.xsl lgtpdfus.xsl

	XSLT files to generate PDF files from the .xml files (formatted either 
	for A4 paper or US Letter paper) using XSL Formatting Objects. Tested 
	with Apache FOP processor (http://xml.apache.org/fop).


texml.xsl

	XSLT file to output TeXML files that can be further processed by  
	TeXMLatte to produce LaTeX files. The TeXMLatte program can be found 
	at: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/texml/.


ie5.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing .xml files in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x 
	(using the outdated Microsoft XML Parser; works with both Macintosh 
	and Windows versions). The links in the (internally generated) HTML 
	files point to related XML files. It can be used to browse and view 
	the XML files directly.


logtalk.dtd

	Document type description describing the structure of the .xml files
	generated by Logtalk.
	

logtalk.xsd

	XML Schema describing the structure of the .xml files generated by 
	Logtalk.


logtalk.css

	Cascade style sheet file to render the HTML output of the .xsl files
	in a web browser.


html.sh

	Sample Unix shell script to batch convert .xml files to .html files.
	Edit the script to match your environment before running it.
	Requires James Clarck XT processor (http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html).


html.bat

	Sample DOS batch script to convert .xml files to .html files.
	Edit the script to match your environment before running it.
	Requires James Clarck XT processor (http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html).


pdf.sh

	Sample Unix shell script to batch convert .xml files to .pdf files.
	Edit the script to match your environment and paper format preference 
	before running it.
	Requires Apache FOP processor (http://xml.apache.org/fop).


pdf.bat

	Sample DOS batch script to convert .xml files to .pdf files.
	Edit the script to match your environment and paper format preference 
	before running it.
	Requires Apache FOP processor (http://xml.apache.org/fop).


Note that you can write other XSLT files for converting the XML files to 
other formats besides PDF, HTML, or LaTeX. You can also write alternative 
CSS and XSLT files to change the appearance of the HTML and LaTeX files.
