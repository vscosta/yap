This folder contains an example that shows how to implement a reflective
class-based system. There are three main classes:

	object - root of the inheritance graph
	class - default metaclass for all instantiable classes
	abstract_class - default metaclass for all abstract classes

Each class inherit all the methods form the other two classes and from 
itself (without any inheritance loops of course ;-).

You can find more sophisticated versions of these classes in the roots
example.
