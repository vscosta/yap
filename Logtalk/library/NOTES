=================================================================
Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.14.1

Copyright (c) 1998-2002 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================

This folder contains objects, categories, and protocols that implement
predicates for dealing with common Prolog types and structures.

To load a group of objects, protocols, and categories in this library 
change your Prolog working directory to this folder and then consult 
the corresponding *.loader utility file. Currently, there are seven 
groups of entities defined:

	dates
	debugging
	events
	hierarchies
	metapredicates
	random
	types

There is also a file named all.loader that will load all entities in the 
seven groups listed above.

Specific notes about each group of objects, categories, and protocols 
can be found in the corresponding *.notes files.

Some files represent work in progress and are not loaded by default by 
any loader utility file.

Some of the code in this library is based on public domain Prolog code, 
in particular, code adopted from the Edinburgh Prolog library.

All source files are formatted using four-spaces tabs.
