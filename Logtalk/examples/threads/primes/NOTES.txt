To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This folder contains a simple multi-threading example with calculating 
prime numbers in a given interval. Try to run the example in single and
multi-processor (or multi-core) computers and compare the results. Most 
Prolog compilers allows you to measure the time taken for proving a goal 
using proprietary predicates.

Note that this example is only meant to illustrate how to use Logtalk 
multi-threading predicates, not to taken as the efficient solution for 
finding primes numbers on a given interval (with or without threads).
