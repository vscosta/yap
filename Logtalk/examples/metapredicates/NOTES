This example shows the use of metapredicates in Logtalk. Metapredicates are 
predicates whose head contains arguments that will be called as goals in the 
body of the predicate definition.

This example defines two objects:

	sort(_)
		this is a parametric object containing a method that implements the
		quicksort sorting algorithm; the parameter is interpreted as the type
		of the elements being sorted
	
	tracer
		this object implements a metapredicate that is used by sort(_) to 
		trace the sorting algorithm steps
