This folder contains some examples of multi-threading programming.
Multi-threading programming is only supported on some Prolog compilers.
Currently this includes SWI-Prolog, YAP, and XSB CVS (make sure that you 
use the multi-threading versions of these Prolog compilers!). Moreover, 
multi-threading may be turned off by default. In order to run the examples, 
you may need to first turn on multi-threading support on the Prolog config 
files.

Some of the examples try to benchmark single-threaded and multi-threaded 
solutions. Depending on the Prolog compiler, the operating-system, and the 
computer used, you may need to adjust the size of the problem data in order 
to find the threshold where multi-threading solutions begin to outperform 
the single-threaded solutions.
