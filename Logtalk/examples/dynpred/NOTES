To load all entities in this example compile and load the loader file:

| ?- logtalk_load(loader).

This folder contains examples of using some of the built-in database 
handling methods. Two hierarchies are provided, one prototype-based, 
and the other class-based, in order to illustrate the differences 
between asserting predicates in a class and in a prototype.

The following objects are defined:

	root
		root of the prototype hierarchy; declares and defines a public,
		dynamic predicate
	descendant
		simple prototype extending the root prototype

	class
		root of the class hierarchy; declares and defines a public predicate
	metaclass
		class metaclass
	instance
		simple instance of class class

	prototype
		simple prototype used to illustrate how the scope of asserted 
		predicates depends on the target object (this, self, or a explicit 
		object)
