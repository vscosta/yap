<b>Welcome to the Logtalk for Mac OS X Installer</b>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk is an open source object-oriented extension to the Prolog programming language. Integrating logic programming with object-oriented and event-driven programming, it is compatible with most Prolog compilers. It supports both prototypes and classes. In addition, it supports component-based programming through category-based composition.

<p>
This installer guides you through the steps necessary to install Logtalk for Mac OS X. Logtalk is installed on the <b>/opt/local/share/logtalk</b> directory. After completing the installation, each Logtalk end-user must run the shell command <b>cplgtdirs</b> once before using the Logtalk &ndash; Prolog integration scripts. This command creates a folder named <b>logtalk</b> on the user's home directory containing configuration files, examples, and documentation. Inside this folder is a link to a <b>CUSTOMIZE.txt</b> file describes how to customize Logtalk for your personal use. Links to the Logtalk &ndash; Prolog integration scripts are created on the <b>/opt/local/bin</b> directory, which must be on your system path. The integration scripts are described on the <b>/opt/local/share/logtalk/scripts/NOTES.txt</b> file.
