	SuperEdi installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

2.	Copy the file "Logtalk.col" to the "Syntax" directory in your 
	SuperEdi installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

3.	Go to the Tools/Options dialog and create a new file type named 
	"Logtalk". Set the file extension to "lgt" and the syntax and color 
	scheme to "Logtalk". Set the tab size to "4".


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
