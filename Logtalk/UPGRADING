Upgrading from Logtalk 1.x
==========================

Logtalk 2.x is not compatible with programs written for version 1.x.
However, you should be able to translate most programs to make them 
run under this new version. Most of the examples provided with previous 
versions have been rewritten to run under version 2.x. Use them as 
translation examples.


Upgrading from a previous Logtalk 2.x version
=============================================

If your Logtalk programs depend on some of the example files, it is
advisable that you check your code against the new version before 
throwing away the older release.

Logtalk source files will need to be recompiled because of the changes 
done in the version 2.5.0 to improve message sending performance.

Logtalk version 2.7.0 provides the first cut of the Logtalk standard library.
Most examples have been rewritten to take advantage of the library.

Logtalk version 2.8.0 introduces a small change on the logtalk_compile/1-2 
and logtalk_load/1-2 predicates that may imply updating your loader utility
files: the first argument is now always a list of entities even if we want 
to compile or load a single entity.

Logtalk version 2.9.0 changes compiled code functors postfixes from "_sdcl" 
and "_sdef" to  "_idcl"	and "_idef", impliying recompilation of all objects, 
protocols, and categories.

Logtalk version 2.10.0 changes some of the semantics of object dynamic 
predicates. See the release notes for a description of the changes.
