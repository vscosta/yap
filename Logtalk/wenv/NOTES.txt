Logtalk - Open source object-oriented logic programming language

================================================================


This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting and 
other text editing services for writing Logtalk source files (*.lgt) 
with common text editors. By default, Logtalk syntax highlighting is 
also applied to the Prolog configuration files (*.config).

Some text editors already include support for Logtalk. If that is the 
case of your favorite editor, you may want to check if the supporting 
files provided in this directory are newer than the editor ones.

Logtalk source files (including the programming examples) are usually 
formatted using four-space tabs; it is recommended that you set the tab 
width on your editor preferences panel.

You may notice that support for some text editors, notably for Windows-only 
editors, is rather poor. Proper syntax highlighting support for Prolog and 
Logtalk requires support for regular expressions with zero-width look-ahead 
features, which some editors lack.

As Logtalk can be viewed as a superset of ISO Prolog, you may also use 
the resources in this directory for editing plain Prolog source files.
