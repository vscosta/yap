To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

If your Prolog compiler does not support a module system, then edit the 
loader.lgt file and comment out the directive that loads the module code.
In case your Prolog compiler supports a module system, you may need to 
edit the code on the module.pl file and make any necessary compatibility 
changes.

This folder provides simple benchmarks for comparing Logtalk message 
sending performance with direct calls to Prolog predicates and with 
calls to module predicates. These benchmarks may also be used for 
comparing Logtalk message sending performance across Prolog compilers.

This example is made of four source files:

	benchmark.pl
		contains the benchmark predicates
	plain.pl
		contains a definition for a list length predicate and a predicate 
		for testing performance of the built-in predicates assertz/1 and 
		retract/1
	module.pl
		contains the same definition of a list length predicate 
		encapsulated in a module
	object.lgt
		contains the same definition of a list length predicate 
		encapsulated in an object
	database.lgt
		contains predicates for testing the performance of the built-in 
		database methods assertz/1 and retract/1


The Prolog files above are loaded (from the loader.lgt file) by using 
ensure_loaded/1 directives. If this directive is not supported on your 
Prolog compiler, replace them by calls to the built-in predicate used 
by your compiler to load Prolog code.
