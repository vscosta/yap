=================================================================
Logtalk - Object oriented extension to Prolog
Release 2.14.7

Copyright (c) 1998-2003 Paulo Moura.  All Rights Reserved.
=================================================================

This folder contains several examples of Logtalk programs. Most of 
these examples need objects, protocols, and categories that are
defined in the Logtalk standard library or in other examples, so 
you should load them first (see the NOTES file inside the library 
folder and inside each example folder).

Some examples may redefine objects already loaded from other examples.
You may want to restart Logtalk after trying each example.

Some of the examples code have been adopted from public available 
Prolog code and from known Prolog text books and are copyrighted by 
the respective authors.

These are programming examples, meaning that you should study the 
source files to fully understand them.

All examples are formatted using four spaces tabs.

By default, compiling an example generates a .xml documenting file for each 
compiled entity (object, category, or protocol). See the xml sub-directory 
for instructions on how to browse the .xml files for on-line reading or how 
to convert the files to print-ready format.
