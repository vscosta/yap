	installation directory.

2.	Open the "catalog" file in the same subdirectory and add (if not 
	present) the following entry:

source files.

You can customize the templates for objects, categories, and protocols 
to use your name by default by changing the line that reads:

#prompt ( "Author name:" $authorname )

to:
