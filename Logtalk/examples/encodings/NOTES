To load this example and for sample queries, please see the SCRIPT file.

This is a very simple example of using the new, experimental encoding/1 
directive, which is fully based on the directive with the same name found 
on recent development releases of SWI-Prolog. Currently, this example 
requires Logtalk to be run with the SWI-Prolog compiler.

The "babel.lgt" source file uses UTF-8 encoding. When browsing its code, 
be sure to use a text editor that supports this encoding. In addition, 
you may need to configure your text editor to open the source file using 
this encoding. If you are using the SWI-Prolog GUI application on Windows, 
be sure to select a font which supports Unicode characters.
