This folder contains several files that enables .xml documentation files 
created when compiling objects, categories, or protocols, to be converted 
to PDF files, to be viewed in a web browser that supports the W3C standards 
XML, XSLT, CSS, and HTML 4 or XHTML 1.0, or to be converted to LateX for 
printing.

You will need to either copy your .xml files to this directory or copy
these files to the directory where the .xml files reside.

Regarding conversion to HTML/XHTML, the links to the .xsl files on the 
.xml files and the links to the .css files in the generated .html files 
assume that all files reside in the same directory.

The choice of the default .xsl file to use is made in the config files by 
the '$lgt_default_flag'/2 predicate. You can also choose a different 
.xsl file by using the xsl/1 compiler option in the logtalk_compile/2 or 
logtalk_load/2 calls. The default file is lgtxml.xsl (described below).

The .xml documenting files can be either generated as standalone XML files 
or contain a reference to either the Logtalk DTD file, logtalk.dtd, or to 
the Logtalk XML Schema file, logtalk.xsd. The reference to the XML 
specification file can be either a local reference or a URI reference. By 
default, all .xml documenting files contain a local reference but that 
can be changed either in the config files, by setting a Logtalk compiler 
flag, or by using the doctype/1 compiler option. Choose the option value 
that works best for your XSLT tools. To choose between the .dtd or .xsd 
specifications use the xmlspec/1 compiler option.


Brief description of each file in this folder:
 

lgthtml.xsl

	XSLT file to output HTML files from the .xml files. The links in the
	generated HTML files point to related HTML files. It can be used to 
	batch convert XML files to HTML files. UTF-8 encoding is assumed. Edit 
	the file if you use a different encoding.


lgtxml.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing .xml files directly in in a browser such as Mozilla 
	(version 0.9.2 or later) or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 for Windows 
	(after installing the latest Microsoft XML Parser Release that is needed 
	for XSL standard compliance). The links in the (internally generated) 
	HTML files point to related XML files. UTF-8 encoding is assumed. Edit 
	the file if you use a different encoding.


lgtxhtml.xsl

	XSLT file to output XHTML 1.0 files from the .xml files. The links in 
	the generated XHTML files point to related XHTML files. It can be used 
	to batch convert XML files to XHTML files. UTF-8 encoding is assumed. 
	Edit the file if you use a different encoding.


lgtpdfa4.xsl
lgtpdfus.xsl

	XSLT files to generate PDF files from the .xml files (formatted either 
	for A4 paper or US Letter paper) using XSL Formatting Objects. Tested 
	with the XSL:FO processors Apache FOP 0.20.5 (http://xml.apache.org/fop), 
	PassiveTeX 1.21 (http://www.tei-c.org.uk/Software/passivetex/), and 
	RenderX 2.77 (http://www.renderx.com/).


texml.xsl

	XSLT file to output TeXML files that can be further processed by  
	TeXMLatte to produce LaTeX files. The TeXMLatte program can be found 
	at: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/texml/.


ie50.xsl

	XSLT file for viewing .xml files in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x 
	(using the outdated Microsoft XML Parser; works with both Macintosh 
	and Windows versions). The links in the (internally generated) HTML 
	files point to related XML files. It can be used to browse and view 
	the XML files directly.


logtalk.dtd

	Document type description describing the structure of the .xml files
	generated by Logtalk.
	

logtalk.xsd

	XML Schema describing the structure of the .xml files generated by 
	Logtalk.


logtalk.css

	Cascade style sheet file to render the HTML/XHTML output of the .xsl 
	files in a web browser.


html.sh

	Sample Unix shell script to batch convert .xml files to .html files.
	The script also generates an index.html file that contains links to all 
	converted files. The title of the index.html can be given as a parameter 
	to the script. Edit the script to match your environment before running 
	it and to chose between HTML or XHTML output. Requires James Clarck XT 
	XSLT processor 20020426a or later version (http://www.jclark.com/xml/).


htmlnt.cmd

	Sample Windows NT batch script to convert .xml files to .html files.
	The script also generates an index.html file that contains links to all 
	converted files. The title of the index.html can be given as a parameter 
	to the script. Edit the script to match your environment before running 
	it and to chose between HTML or XHTML output. Requires James Clarck XT 
	XSLT processor 20020426a or later version (http://www.jclark.com/xml/).


htmldos.bat

	Sample DOS batch script to convert .xml files to .html files. Edit the 
	script to match your environment before running it and to chose between 
	HTML or XHTML output. Requires James Clarck XT XSLT processor 20020426a 
	or later version (http://www.jclark.com/xml/).


pdf.sh

	Sample Unix shell script to batch convert .xml files to .pdf files.
	Edit the script to match your environment and paper format preference 
	before running it. Requires Apache FOP processor (http://xml.apache.org/fop).
	Tested with version 0.20.5 (to workaround a bug on the XALAN processor used 
	by FOP, you should use the compiler option doctype(standalone) when compiling 
	your Logtalk source files).


pdf.bat

	Sample DOS batch script to convert .xml files to .pdf files.
	Edit the script to match your environment and paper format preference 
	before running it. Requires Apache FOP processor (http://xml.apache.org/fop).
	Tested with version 0.20.5 (to workaround a bug on the XALAN processor used 
	by FOP, you should use the compiler option doctype(standalone) when compiling 
	your Logtalk source files).


Note that you can write other XSLT files for converting the XML files to 
other formats besides PDF, HTML, or LaTeX. You can also write alternative 
CSS and XSLT files to change the appearance of the HTML and LaTeX files.
